Abstract

   This document describes the foundational principles governing
   “The Offline Society,” a decentralized, non-registered, and
   non-digital social formation. These rules define operational,
   social, and ethical constraints intended to preserve autonomy,
   self-reliance, and organic organization without reliance on
   digital infrastructure.

1. Introduction

   “The Offline Society” exists as a response to pervasive digital
   mediation. It does not begin at a specific point in time, nor does
   it require formal recognition. This document does not define an
   organization but rather a set of constraints under which social
   activity may occur.

2. Terminology

   The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, and “MAY”
   in this document are to be interpreted in a practical, human sense
   rather than a legalistic one.

   OFFLINE
      The absence of digital devices, networks, platforms, or records.

   MEMBER
      Any person who participates in a happening aligned with these
      rules, whether knowingly or unknowingly.

   HAPPENING
      Any gathering, event, action, or shared activity realized under
      these constraints.

3. Core Principles

3.1. Total Offline Operation

   All activities MUST remain offline.

   Digital devices MUST NOT be used to publish, document, organize, or
   communicate about happenings. Information dissemination MUST occur
   solely via physical paper or spoken word, and only to other
   participants.

3.2. Absence of Membership Registers

   No formal or informal register of members SHALL be maintained.

   Social circles remain open and unconstrained by inclusion or
   exclusion dynamics. Sign-ups SHOULD be avoided and MAY only occur
   when material scarcity makes minimal coordination unavoidable.

   Attendance is assumed to self-select: the right people will arrive.

3.3. Encouraged Fission and Independence

   Participants MAY split off at any time.

   Independence is encouraged. There are no permanent leaders. Action
   and realization define participation. Individuals MUST recognize
   and act upon their own boundaries.

3.4. Education over Authority

   Informal hierarchies MAY arise naturally due to differences in
   confidence, speed, or volume.

   To prevent these from ossifying into inherited authority, those
   with influence SHOULD actively teach others the skills and
   knowledge they possess. Leadership is treated as a temporary,
   transferable condition.

3.5. Radical Self-Reliance

   Each participant is responsible for their own well-being.

   No implicit safety net is guaranteed by the society. Mutual aid
   MAY occur, but responsibility cannot be delegated.

4. Operational Notes

   “The Offline Society” has already begun.

   Participation does not require invitation. If no invitation has
   been received, participants SHOULD create a happening themselves.
   Independently emerging bubbles are expected to merge organically
   over time without coordination.

5. Security Considerations

   The absence of digital records reduces certain surveillance risks
   while increasing reliance on trust, memory, and physical presence.
   Participants are advised to exercise situational awareness and
   personal responsibility.

6. Acknowledgements

   This document acknowledges all past, present, and future
   participants who acted first and explained later.
